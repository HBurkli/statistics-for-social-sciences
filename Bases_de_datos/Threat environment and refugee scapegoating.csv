These are ethnic Nepalis living in Bhutan: Bhutan has claimed that they left willingly or were never citizens, and resisted their return. The refugees insisted they were forced to flee because of their ethnicity and that they wanted to return. About 100,000 refugees arrived in Nepal from Bhutan over a short period of time in the early 1990s. They were given status, but forced to live in closed camps, and there was strong reluctance towards integrating them, on the grounds of their number, and the politics and timing of their arrival.95 Over some fifteen years thirteen tripartite meetings were held between UNHCR, Nepal and Bhutan had focused on repatriation and some local integration, with resettlement held off as the solution that could be used for those who could neither return nor integrate, while also demonstrating solidarity with the two countries. Return was the solution of choice for the refugees, and they were broadly supported in this as the international approach to refugee issues has involved a strong focus on and preference for voluntary repatriation. The situation of the Bhutanese in Nepal first came to the attention of US based resettlement players in 2000, when USCRI visited Tibetans in Nepal and, as a side visit also looked at the camps in which Bhutanese were living. Returning to Washington DC the NGO actors asked the government and UNHCRÃ°s DC office what could be done for these refugees. At about the same time there was a dual scandal for UNHCR in Nepal, centring on both finances and the non-prevention of domestic and sexual abuse in the camps for Bhutanese,96 triggering a harder look at the situation. Bhutan was encouraged through a joint verification mission, indicate how many would fall into each of three categories for return: yes, no, or maybe. Only two per cent of refugees were identified by the Bhutanese authorities as definitely meeting criteria for return, triggering a riot in the camp."",http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home/opendocPDFViewer.html?docid=520a3e559&query=camp%20riot,.,LexisNexis,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,127940,11.75932,0.548744,1,1,6,6,5.62736";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
